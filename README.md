# What is Common Table Expression
A common table expression (CTE) is a named temporary result set that exists within the scope of a single statement and that can be referred to later within that statement, possibly multiple times.

# Key Benefits
1. Readability :
   Explanation: It can make your SQL code more readable and easier to understand by giving meaningful names to parts of your query.
   Example: Instead of nesting multiple subqueries, you can define each subquery as a CTE, making the overall query structure clearer and more logical.
2. Reusability :
   Explanation: CTEs can be referenced multiple times within the same query. This eliminates the need to repeat code, making your queries more efficient and reducing the 
   chance of errors.
   Example: If you have a complex calculation or a result set that needs to be used in multiple places within a query, you can define it once as a CTE and reuse it.
3. Maintainability :
   Explanation: Because CTEs simplify complex queries and reduce code repetition, they make SQL code easier to maintain. When changes are needed, you can update the CTE in 
   one 
   place rather than modifying multiple instances of the same logic throughout your query.
   Example: If the logic for a specific calculation changes, you only need to update the CTE rather than every occurrence of that calculation in the query.
4. Support for Recursion :
   Explanation: CTEs support recursive queries, which are useful for hierarchical data or when dealing with scenarios where the output of one step needs to feed into the 
   next. Recursive CTEs allow you to perform iterative operations within a query.
   Example: You can use a recursive CTE to traverse a tree structure, such as an organizational hierarchy, or to solve problems like generating a sequence of numbers.

# Syntax of CTE

WITH cte_name AS (
    -- CTE definition
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
)
-- Main query
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM cte_name;
